// OOPs and Features

    //OOPs - object oriented programming
    //oops is a concept of objects, which contain both data (attributes or properties)
    // and methods (functions or procedures) that manipulate the data.
    // OOP emphasizes reusability, modularity, and abstraction.

    //features -
    //encapsulation
    //abstraction
    //inheritance
    //polymorphism

//    Here are the key features of OOP:
//
//            1. Encapsulation
//    Definition: Encapsulation refers to bundling the data (attributes) and
//    the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, or class.
//    It also involves restricting access to some of an object's components.
//    Example: In a class, attributes can be made private, while methods can be public
//    to control how the data is accessed and modified.
//            Benefit: It helps protect the internal state of an object and prevents
//            unintended interference.

//2. Abstraction
//    Definition: Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details and
//    showing only the essential features of an object.
//    Example: A car object exposes methods like start() or drive() but hides the internal
//    mechanisms of how the engine works.
//    Benefit: Reduces complexity and allows the programmer to focus on interactions at a
//    higher level.

//            3. Inheritance
//    Definition: Inheritance allows a new class (subclass) to inherit the attributes and
//    methods of an existing class (superclass). This promotes code reusability.
//    Example: A Vehicle class might have common properties like speed, while a Car class
//    inherits from Vehicle but adds additional features specific to cars.
//    Benefit: Facilitates reusability, modularity, and extends functionality without
//    modifying existing code.

//4. Polymorphism
//    Definition: Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects
//    of a common superclass. It also allows a method to behave differently based on the
//    object calling it.
//    Example: A method draw() might behave differently for Circle, Rectangle, or Triangle
//    objects, each having their own implementation of draw().
//    Benefit: Provides flexibility in code by allowing multiple implementations under a
//    unified interface.
